To run the code for a lesson, go to
corresponding directory. Make sure
the script build.sh is executable and then
execute the following commands from
your terminal

````
$ shards install
$ ./build.sh
$ ./a.out
````

The build.sh script will compile and link a lesson
and produces the executable a.out
